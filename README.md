# Digital Rights Explained, A Book About The Internet & Human Rights

On our website we try to give easy to understand and bite sized explanations on the ethics of the Internet and tech in general, on our book you will find more thorough explanations, arguments and ideas to support said views.

If our blog and social media posts are meant as an introduction we want to provide our book, podcasts and interviews as a long term exploration of the big ideas regarding the web.
